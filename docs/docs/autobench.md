author: Yunhao Zhou

## This is scripts to test verilog generated by LLM in terms of their syntax and function.

* The example of how to use it is in the fold named "arithmetic_modi".

* The script_processfile.py can store the acc_1.v acc_2.v in different fold.![pic1](./pic1.png)
* And then, you can run the script_processfilenext.py to copy the testbench.v into all the accu_[0-4], please guarantee the testbench.v is in the same dir with accu_[0-4], **don't forget to change the name of instance in the testbench.**
* Finally, you can run the script_general.py to generate the test result.
* **Don't forget to change the dir_base before run the scripts.**![pic2](./pic2.png)
